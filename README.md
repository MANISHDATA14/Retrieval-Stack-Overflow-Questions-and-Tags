# Retrieval-Stack-Overflow-Questions-and-Tags
Stack Overflow is a popular Q&amp;A website for programmers, where users can post questions related to programming and get answers from the community. Each question is associated with one or more tags that describe the topic of the question. The objective of this project is to build a question tagging system that can automatically assign tags.
